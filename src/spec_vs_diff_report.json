  "summary": "Diff adds centralized copy for confirmation message, initial and progressive love notes, and a full love letter; introduces progressive note reveal logic and adds several global CSS animations/theme tweaks. Some key UX acceptance criteria (post-Yes layout, persistent notes visibility, and letter rendering) are not directly verifiable due to truncation of ValentineProposal.tsx.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Keep romantic love text visible throughout the experience (before and after answering Yes), so the page always shows at least a small set of love notes even after the success/confirmation state is displayed.",
      "reason": "The diff shows initial notes exist in content, but the component code is truncated before we can confirm that love notes remain visible in the post-Yes confirmation UI (not fully replaced).",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Reveal a long-form love letter only after the user clicks/taps Yes, formatted as a readable letter with paragraph breaks and the signature “Yours, Aditya ❤️”.",
      "reason": "The full letter text (including the signature) is present in centralized content, but the component diff is truncated before the post-Yes rendering and formatting (paragraph/line-break preservation, mobile-friendly layout/scroll behavior) can be confirmed.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "After clicking/tapping Yes, display additional small note elements progressively with gentle romantic animations, without external libraries.",
      "reason": "Timing/state logic for progressive reveal is shown (setTimeout every 400ms), and progressive notes exist in content, but the component diff is truncated before we can confirm the actual rendering of the progressively-revealed note elements and their non-overlapping/mobile-friendly layout.",

      "description": "Global romantic theme overhaul with OKLCH color token changes and multiple new general-purpose animations (heart-beat, spin-slow, scale-in, fade-in-up, etc.).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on persistent notes, love letter reveal, progressive notes, and confirmation copy; a broad palette/animation expansion is not explicitly requested (though it may support the desired feel).",

  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented in LastChanceNoModal: the cat-reference line is removed, and the modal image/alt text now reference a panda asset under /assets/generated/. However, the diff also introduces additional unrequested UI/copy/behavior changes inside the modal (new title/copy, Escape key handling, and an explicit close button).",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Additional modal copy changes beyond removing the single specified line (e.g., new title \"Really? 🐼\" and new description paragraphs/hint).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to remove the specific line and update cat->panda references; it explicitly listed non-goals about changing other copy outside the No modal, and did not request broader copy rewrites within the modal.",
      "evidence": [

    {
      "description": "Added new dismissal/interaction behavior: explicit close (X) button and custom Escape key listener to close the modal.",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-1/REQ-2; acceptance criteria only mentioned preserving rendering/sizing and button functionality, not adding new close mechanisms.",

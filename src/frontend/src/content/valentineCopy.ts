  loveLetter: `My baby,

If you're reading this, it means you've already seen how much you mean to me. And honestly, writing all this wasn't easy, not because I didn't know what to say, but because loving you is something I feel more than I can ever explain properly.

Loving you just… happened. I didn't plan it, I didn't expect it, but once it did, there was no turning back. You became my comfort without even trying. You became the person I want to talk to about everything, the good days, the bad days, and even the small, silly things.

Even with the distance, you're always with me. You're in my thoughts when I wake up, and you're the last thing on my mind before I sleep. Every time I imagine my future, you're there so naturally that I can't picture it any other way. You don't feel like just a part of my life, you feel like home.

I won't pretend everything is perfect. We have our moments, our fights, our misunderstandings. But even on those days, my love for you never feels smaller. If anything, it feels stronger. I don't want perfect, I want us. I want to grow together, learn together, and keep choosing each other no matter what.

So today, with a slightly nervous heart and a lot of love, I want to ask you something that means everything to me.

Will you be my Valentine?
Will you keep being mine, the way I want to keep being yours?

I don't promise perfection, but I promise honesty, effort, and a love that won't give up on you. I promise to stand by you, to support you, and to love you in all the little ways that matter.

I love you, my baby.
My everything.
Always you.

Yours,
Aditya ❤️`
